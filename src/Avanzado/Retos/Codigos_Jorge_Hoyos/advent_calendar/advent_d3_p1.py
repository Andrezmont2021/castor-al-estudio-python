# Advent of code, day 3, part 1. Calcular las variables gamma y epsilon considerando los binarios 
# Considering only the first bit of each number, there are five 0 bits and seven 1 bits. 
# Since the most common bit is 1, the first bit of the gamma rate is 1.
#The most common value of the third, fourth, and fifth bits are 1, 1, and 0, respectively, and so the final three bits of the gamma rate are 110.
# So, the gamma rate is the binary number 10110, or 22 in decimal
#The epsilon rate is calculated in a similar way; rather than use the most common bit, 
# the least common bit from each position is used. So, the epsilon rate is 01001, or 9 in decimal. 
# Multiplying the gamma rate (22) by the epsilon rate (9) produces the power consumption, 198.
